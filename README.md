Data analysis of factors influencing Visa approvals
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US permits foreign workers to come to the United
States to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against
adverse impacts on their wages or working conditions by ensuring US employers' compliance with
statutory requirements when they hire foreign workers to fill workforce shortages.
The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can
help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. We analyzed data with
the help of classification models to:
▪ Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
▪ Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied
based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.
